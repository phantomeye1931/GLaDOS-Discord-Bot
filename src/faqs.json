    "question": "What blocks are portalable in the mod?",
    "answer": "By default, at least at the moment, the list of blocks you can place portals on includes Endstone, Portalable Panels added by us, and types of Concrete. However, **this list is fully configurable** by using datapacks to modify the block tag in your world, so if you want any blocks to be portalable as well, that's possible."

    "question": "How can I help playtesting / translating?",
    "answer": "Currently, we're still working on getting the mod ready for stages of playtesting and translating, so **more information on how will be posted in <#878221699844309033> when we could use your help**! If you've got the <:ph_portalmod:1166824918395146330>**Portal Mod** Role, we'll notify you! For the time being, feel free to post feedback and ideas in <#876477593245868114>, we love to hear what you think."

    "id": "game_platform",
    "question": "Is the mod for Java or Bedrock?",
    "answer": "We are developing the mod for Minecraft: Java Edition. Sadly we won't be able to support any other versions of Minecraft, since all of those versions of the game use completely different systems and are in no way compatible. We would have to make the mod from scratch for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, which is something we simply don't want to spend time on, instead making the mod for Minecraft: Java Edition as good as we can!"
  },
  {
    "id": "mod_loader",
    "question": "What mod loader will the mod use?",
    "answer": "The mod is being developed for Forge, as it's simply our preferred mod loader. There might be ports to Fabric in the future, but the mod itself will be developed for Forge."
  },
  {
    "id": "game_version",
    "question": "For which version of Minecraft is the mod?",
    "answer": "The mod is currently being developed for Minecraft 1.16.5, since that was the latest version when we started development. However, we are planning on keeping the mod updated to the latest version of Minecraft once the mod has been released."
  },
  {
    "id": "denied_suggestions",
    "question": "Why won't you add ___?",
    "answer": "One of the main reasons we don't add a lot of things, is because of the concept of quality over quantity. We want to make sure that everything we add into the game feels polished and has a purpose. We want to focus on adding things to the game in such a way, that they can be used in multiple ways when playing the game. This also goes for characters like cores and GLaDOS."
  },
  {
    "id": "mod_compatibility",
    "question": "Will you add support for the ___ mod?",
    "answer": "Making this mod is a lot of work, so unfortunately we currently can't focus on adding support for any mods. This includes mods like Create, shader mods and others. That doesn't mean they won't be compatible, we just can't (for the moment) ensure that they will."
  },
  {
    "id": "alternate_blocks",
    "question": "Will you add Portal 1 / Old Aperture styled testing elements?",
    "answer": "As mentioned a few FAQ questions above, we prefer to avoid adding too many blocks with the same function but different visuals. This means we probably won't add Portal 1 or Old Aperture styled testing elements. However, we try to support customization as much as possible, so you can use a resource pack to change the looks of almost everything we add!"
  },
  {
    "id": "generating_structures",
    "question": "Will there be automatically generated test chambers in the world?",
    "answer": "We're currently not planning on generating any pre-built test chambers in the world, but this might change later. We simply provide the tools and materials for you to get creative exploring Portal mechanics in Minecraft."
