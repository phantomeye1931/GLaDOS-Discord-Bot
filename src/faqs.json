    "question": "What blocks can you place Portals on?",
    "answer": "By default, the list of blocks you can place Portals on includes **Endstone, the mod's new Portalable Blocks, and all types of Concrete**. However, **this list is fully configurable**. You can use datapacks to modify this list (a block tag) in your world. This means that you can make any blocks you'd like portalable. You can instead also define which blocks are ***not*** portalable, which will make all blocks not on the list portalable."

    "question": "Can I help playtesting / translating?",
    "answer": "Currently, we're still working on getting the mod ready for stages of playtesting and translating. Once we get to those stages of development, **more information on how we could use your help will be posted in <#878221699844309033>**! If you've got the <:ph_portalmod:1166824918395146330>**Portal Mod** Role, we'll notify you! For the time being, feel free to post feedback and ideas in <#876477593245868114>, we love to hear what you think."

    "question": "Is the mod for Java or Bedrock?",
    "answer": "**This mod is being developed for *Minecraft: Java Edition***. Sadly we won't be able to support any other editions of Minecraft, since all different editions of the game are completely different code-wise and are in no way compatible. The only way to achieve *Minecraft: Bedrock Edition* (or for example console) support is to remake the mod from scratch for those games, which is simply something we can't spend time on, sorry! Instead we're focusing on making our mod as good as it can be for *Java Edition*."

  {
    "id": "mod_loader",
    "question": "What mod loader does PortalMod use?",
    "answer": "The mod is being developed for Minecraft Forge, as it's simply our preferred mod loader. There might be ports to Fabric (or other mod loaders) in the future, but that's not something we're working on at all at the moment."
  },
  {
    "id": "game_version",
    "question": "For which Minecraft version is PortalMod?",
    "answer": "The mod is currently being developed for Minecraft 1.16.5, since that was the latest version when we started development. However, we're certainly planning on updating the mod to the latest version of the game sometime. This might be before or after release. We'll let you know when we know more."
  },
  {
    "id": "denied_suggestions",
    "question": "Why won't you add ___?",
    "answer": "One of the main reasons are denying a lot of suggestions, is because we value the overall quality of the mod over the amount of features that we add. This means that we'll always prioritize polishing the fundamental features of the mod over adding new things. We want to make sure that the mod feels finished and that everything has a purpose. We want to focus on adding things to the game in such a way, that they take all ways of playing the game into account, including creative and full survival compatibility and balancing. This is also sadly the part of the development process where we have to make the decision to not add things like cores and GLaDOS."
  },
  {
    "id": "mod_compatibility",
    "question": "Will you add support for the ___ mod?",
    "answer": "Developing this mod on it's own is already a lot of work. Designing the mod to be compatible with other mods would take even more time and effort. This means that sadly we have to shove mod compatibility at the bottom of the priority pile. This means that your favorite mods like Create, Optifine (shaders) and other fantastic mods will likely not be compatible with PortalMod, at least for the time being. That doesn't mean they won't be compatible, we just can't ensure that they will."

  {
    "id": "alternate_blocks",
    "question": "Will you add Portal 1 / Old Aperture styled testing elements?",
    "answer": "We prefer to avoid adding too many blocks with the same function to keep all different items and blocks feel fresh and unique. This means we probably won't add testing elements with multiple visuals, such as Portal 1 or Old Aperture styled testing elements. However, this isn't necessarily the case with building blocks, so don't lose hope for your overgrown styled test chamber yet! We also try to support customization as much as possible, so you can use a resource pack to change the looks of almost everything we add!"

  {
    "id": "generating_structures",
    "question": "Will there be automatically generated test chambers in the world?",
    "answer": "We're currently not planning on generating any pre-built test chambers in the world, rather focusing on providing you the tools to create your own test chambers from existing materials you can find around the world. This is also something which might change in the future, but for now, get ready to collect some materials in order to build your test."
